# Horse Position 2D Animation

This project generates 2D animations of horse positions during a race using HTML Canvas. The animation can then be saved using the MediaRecorder API.

## Getting Started

To view the animation, simply open `index.html` in a web browser.

To record the animation, click the "Start Recording" button. The animation will be captured as an MP4 file.

## Race Movie
The race starts at 1:20 of the original movie and the top horse crosses the finish line at 2:56. The animation, however, focuses on the segment from 1:39 to 2:49.

## Technology

This project uses **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, ensuring it can be run directly in any modern web browser without a complex build setup.
