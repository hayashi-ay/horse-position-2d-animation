# Horse Position 2D Animation

This project generates 2D animations of horse positions during a race using HTML Canvas. The animation can then be saved using the MediaRecorder API.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the canvas and includes the stylesheet and JavaScript.
- `style.css`: Provides basic styling for the HTML elements.
- `script.js`: Contains the core logic for drawing the horse animation on the canvas and utilizing the MediaRecorder API to capture the animation.
